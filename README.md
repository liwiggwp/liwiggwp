# About Me
I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Mathematical Support and Administration of Information Systems at Tyumen State University.

In 2023, I was awarded a grant to implement a project focused on creating a game-based web platform that provides information about university programs through narrative stories. The platform is designed for high school seniors and first-year university students to help them explore different academic paths. You can check out the demo version here: [Test Version.](https://p-pupa.zhmyak.com/.)
